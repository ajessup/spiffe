# GERI JENNINGS
Geri is an engineering manager who has been involved in SPIFFE and SPIRE since her time at CyberArk, in particular working on the adjacent products Conjur and Secretless. I believe she'd make an excellent SSC member due to (a) her domain experience in authentication and secrets management, (b) her experience in catalysing and maintaining open-source communities, and (c) her continued passion and investment in the SPIFFE project.
